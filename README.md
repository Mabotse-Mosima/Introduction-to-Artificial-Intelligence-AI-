# Introduction-to-Artificial-Intelligence-AI-

In this module, I learned the definition of AI and the basics of generative AI. I explored the impact, applications, and use cases of AI and how it is transforming our daily lives. I also discovered common tools and applications of generative AI. I learned about AI agents and smart assistants, along with their typical use cases. Finally, I examined how AI is reshaping various industries and sectors.

In another module, I studied the core concepts of AI, including deep learning, machine learning, and neural networks. I explored generative AI models, especially large language models (LLMs), and their capabilities. I also learned how AI is applied in fields like natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, and robotics, and how these technologies are driving innovation and new use cases.

In the module focusing on AI in business, I explored how AI and generative AI are transforming business operations. I learned about the benefits AI offers to organizations and reviewed real-world use cases. I also discovered how AI could change the way I work and the nature of the workplace. I learned about different AI career paths and the opportunities in this growing field. Additionally, I studied the frameworks used for AI adoption, including a detailed look at IBMâ€™s AI Ladder framework.

Finally, I completed a module focused on AI ethics and governance. I learned about the key principles of ethical AI and how they can be applied in practice. The module covered the ethical concerns related to generative AI and how governance and regulations help enforce ethical standards. At the end, I completed a final project and a graded quiz to assess my understanding of everything I had learned throughout the course.
